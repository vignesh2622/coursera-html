  <h1>The paragraphs</h1>
  <h2>sub para</h2>
  <p class ="h3">
  The Paragraphs module in Drupal provides editors with a component driven architecture for building pages. Morpht has been developing Paragraph approaches to site building since 2015. This case study captures some of the content from a Drupal 7 "Paragraphs Demo" site which was built to showcase what could be done with Paragraphs.

 <p>How about not including demo modules with the distribution of your production level module? Or at least putting a warning in the install routine and/or readme file. I just upgraded to 8.x-1.2 today, then upgraded my core to 8.4. After that I had warnings in my status report about needing to update the published field and a behavior field related to paragraphs.</p>
